Call me a pervert, call me a freak
I want every part of you inside every part of me

Call me a pervert, call me a freak
I want every part of you inside every part of me

Go ahead let me watch you
Watch you watching me
Let me call you baby, let me call you queen
Let me breath in for you, let me be obscene
Let me tell you way too much about me, my queen

I want every part of you inside every part of me

Mi rumba
I own what I have, I have what I want, I want you
I want what I have, I want to know, want to own you
I own what I have, I have what I want, I want you
I want what I have, I want to know, want to own you

Mi rumba, danza con mi rumba
Mi rumba, danza con mi rumba
Mi rumba, danza con mi rumba
Mi rumba, danza con mi rumba

Let me watch your hips slow motion like a rumba
We can work your body like they do it in Cuba
What I do to you, what I do to you
You gone feel exhausted like you shopping in Shibuya

Go ahead let me watch you
Watch you watching me
Let me call you baby, let me call you queen
Let me breath in for you, let me be obscene
Let me tell you way too much about me, my queen
(My queen, my queen, my queen...)

You can be the one to lead and carve yourself into me
You can put me in a bind 'cause I'm already free
We can lap it up, lick it up
Every last trick I love
Lick it like an animal feed
I'm a woman with an appetite, not afraid to say what I need

Mi rumba, danza con mi rumba
Mi rumba, danza con mi rumba
Mi rumba, danza con mi rumba
Mi rumba, danza con mi rumba
