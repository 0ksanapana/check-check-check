Call me a pervert, call me a freak
I want every part of you inside every part of me

Call me a pervert, call me a freak
I want every part of you inside every part of me

Go ahead let me watch you
Watch you watching me
Let me call you baby, let me call you queen
Let me breath in for you, let me be obscene
Let me tell you way too much about me, my queen

I want every part of you inside every part of me
